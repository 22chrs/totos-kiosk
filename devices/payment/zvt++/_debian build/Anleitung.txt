Guide to Setting Up a C++ Development Environment with Boost and CMake on Debian under WSL

1. Install Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) on Windows:
   - Open Windows Terminal.
   - Run the command to enable WSL:
     wsl --install

2. Install Debian for WSL via the Windows Store:
   - Open Microsoft Store.
   - Search for and install "Debian".

3. Install CMake on Debian:
   - Update package lists:
     sudo apt-get update
   - Install CMake:
     sudo apt-get install cmake

4. Download Boost on Windows:
   - Visit the Boost website and download the .bz2 file for the required version.

5. Copy Boost Archive from Windows to Debian:
   - Use the cp command to transfer the file:
     cp /mnt/c/path-to-boost-file /desired-debian-directory

6. Install Boost:
   - Unpack the Boost archive and navigate to its directory.
   - Prepare for build:
     ./bootstrap.sh
   - Build and install with the -fPIC flag and shared linking:
     ./b2 cxxflags=-fPIC install
     ./b2 link=shared install

7. Delete Existing CMake Cache:
   - Navigate to your project directory.
   - Remove the old CMake cache file, especially if it contains Windows paths (like /mnt/ paths):
     rm CMakeCache.txt

8. Generate a New CMake Cache File:
   - This step is usually automatically done when running CMake in the next step.

9. Create a Build Directory:
   - Inside the project directory, create a build directory:
     mkdir build
   - Navigate into this directory:
     cd build

10. Run CMake to Configure the Project:
    - Inside the build directory, run CMake pointing to the source:
      cmake ..

11. Build the Project:
    - Inside the build directory, run make:
      make

After following these steps, you'll have a development environment set up on Debian under WSL for C++ projects using Boost and CMake.
